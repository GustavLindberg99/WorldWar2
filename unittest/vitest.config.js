//Empty vitest.config.js file so that the vitest knows which folder the unit tests are in.
//For the vitest vscode extension to work, go to File > Preferences > Settings > Extensions > Vitest
//and set "Vitest Package Path" to the path where vitest's package.json is located (for example if
//vitest is installed globally on Windows, that would be
//`C:\Program Files\nodejs\node_modules\vitest\package.json`).
